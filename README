---------------------------TASK LIST-------------------------
5/30
For mopplayer - Startup
Basic contorl code for Arduino UNO.
This may not be required in final state.
ISSIUE:
for Bananapi, it needs at last 4 PWM output pins,
2x4 digital output pins, 4 TX/RX pins of the sensors.

6/10
For mopplayer - 4 motors
Basic control code for 4 motors
ISSIUE:
Would sensors interact with arduino or bananapi?
If it is arduino, it will need more pins for 4 RX/TX 
or 4 digital in/output , so UNO=>Mega2560.
If it is bananapi, it will need 4 RX/TX or 4 digital in/output
, so still use UNO.

6/14
For mopplayer - Test code for distance
Using WiringC lib for bananapi.
Later, I will combine to control motors.
ISSIUE:
The distance is sometimes to lead 0.
It seem some errors on system.

6/15
For mopplayer - combine arduino to bananapi
Done.
Beta version release.
ISSIUE:
The current overhead will damage the board.
Using two port to supply the power.

6/18
Revise APIs to make them comprehensive and easy for future use.
